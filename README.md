# ProgrammingLanguage
Petar Spasic

1. I chose C# language

2. I chose this language because it is similar to Java in syntax.

3. The program creates a new object in the while loop  called cell which indicates the row that contains all attributes that I created. Reads data from the file and stores it in a string array while reader has not reached end of stream. Used object regx to split comma between the data and assigned to the string array values. The method transform replaces anyinvalid data with null. Chops the string to just a number for the columns that have year, body weight and display size.

4. I used the Regex library to match the year for year columns, to get body weight in grams and to get display size in inches. The Collections.Generic library I used to create a dictionary with a integer key and object value. 
   I used IO library in order to get data from the cells.csv file.
